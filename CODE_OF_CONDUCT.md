## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a minimal set of social rules: be respectful, constructive, and inclusive. Harassment, discrimination, or hostile behaviour is not tolerated. If you experience or witness such conduct, please contact the maintainers.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arctgz.git
   cd arctgz
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote** to keep your fork in sync:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mroczect/arctgz.git
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

---

## Development Environment

- **Rust**: Install the latest stable Rust toolchain via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Dependencies**: The project uses several crates (`flate2`, `sha2`, `ed25519-dalek`, etc.). They will be fetched automatically by Cargo.
- **OS support**: Development is primarily on Linux, but the library is tested on macOS and Windows. Ensure cross-platform compatibility for any new code (avoid platform-specific assumptions unless properly guarded with `#[cfg]`).
- **Optional tools**:
  - `groff` – for rendering the man page locally (optional).
  - `cross` – for 32-bit testing (see CI workflow).
  - `snapcat` – used internally by maintainers to generate code snapshots.

## Building and Testing

All commands below are run from the repository root.

### Build

```bash
cargo build
```

To build with optimisations:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run tests

```bash
cargo test
```

This runs unit tests, integration tests (located in `tests/`), and doc-tests. All tests must pass before a pull request is accepted.

### Lint and format

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

These are enforced in CI. Run them locally to avoid surprises.

### Man page

The man page source is `manual/arctgz.7`. You can render it to a terminal for inspection:

```bash
man ./manual/arctgz.7
```

If you modify the man page, ensure the formatting remains valid groff. The CI pipeline also deploys an HTML version to GitHub Pages via `docs.yml`.

---

## Coding Style

- Follow the standard Rust formatting (enforced by `cargo fmt`).
- Use `rustc` and `clippy` lints strictly; any warning is treated as an error in CI.
- Write idiomatic Rust:
  - Use `Result` and `Option` appropriately.
  - Prefer `From` implementations for error conversions.
  - Document public API items with `///` comments, including safety considerations for `unsafe` blocks (if any).
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Add tests for new functionality.
- For FFI or platform-specific code, guard with `#[cfg(...)]` attributes.

---

## Commit Messages

Use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
type(scope): short description

Optional longer explanation.
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`, `refactor`, `style`.

**Scope**: `arctgz` (for core library), `ffi`, `ci`, `docs`, etc.

Examples:

- `feat(arctgz): add encryption support via aes-gcm`
- `fix(arctgz): handle empty directory entries correctly`
- `docs(arctgz): update man page for v0.8.0`

This format enables automatic changelog generation and clear history.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is based on an up-to-date `master`.
2. Run `cargo test`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` to verify there are no issues.
3. If you added or modified public API, update the man page (`manual/arctgz.7`) and README as necessary.
4. Push your branch and open a pull request against the `master` branch of the main repository.
5. In the PR description:
   - Explain what the change does and why.
   - Mention any breaking changes.
   - Link to any related issues.
   - Note if documentation updates are included.
6. The CI will run automatically. All checks must be green.
7. A maintainer will review your code. Please respond to feedback and make requested changes.
8. Once approved, the PR will be merged via squash merge to keep the history linear.

## Reporting Bugs

Open an issue on GitHub and include:

- A clear description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Expected vs actual behaviour.
- Environment details: OS, Rust version (`rustc --version`), arctgz version or commit hash.
- If applicable, a minimal code example that demonstrates the bug.

---

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. When opening an issue:

- Describe the feature and the problem it solves.
- Explain how it fits into the library's scope.
- Be open to discussion about design and implementation.

For large features, consider opening an issue first to gather feedback before writing code.

---

## Documentation

- The primary API documentation is the man page (`manual/arctgz.7`). Use `groff` syntax.
- The README serves as a quick overview.
- Release notes are created in `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for each version (by maintainers).
- If you add a new public type or function, update the man page accordingly. Examples in the man page should be complete and correct.

---

## Community

- The main communication channel is GitHub issues and pull requests.
- For questions or informal discussion, you can reach out via the repository's Discussions tab if enabled.

Thank you for contributing to arctgz. Your effort helps make the project better for everyone.
